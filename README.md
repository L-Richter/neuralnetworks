# neuralnetworks

This repository contains material I created while trying to learn about neural networks. This includes:
* An implementation of a neural network and stochastics gradient descent close to http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html including unittests and an application to the mnist data set.
* Some solutions to the exercises in the book Neural Networks - A Systematic Introduction by Raul Rojas available at https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/
