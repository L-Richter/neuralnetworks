The automaton $A$ has to give $10^{M}-10^{M-1}$ different outputs when multiplying $a$ with the $M$ digit numbers. But $A$ has only $N$ states it can be in after reading the two numbers in and has at most $M$ bits of output while reading in, therefore $A$ only can produce $N + M$ different outputs.
